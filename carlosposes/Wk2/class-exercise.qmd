# My favorite equation

The fundamental problem of causal inference:

$$\pi_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$

Where $\pi_i$ represents the causal effect, and $Y_i(1)$ represents the outcome under treatment 1, and $Y_i(0)$ represents the outcome under treatment 0.

# Some information about me

I hardly ever speak Spanish, not even to my friends or family in Spain.
