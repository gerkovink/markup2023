These are the deliverables from Carlos Gonz√°lez Poses for the Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming course. 

My first deliverable is the manuscript of my research report, in the .zip file "manuscript". A view link on Overleaf, which may be more convenient, can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/vqffbdzbqskd#fa69ff

My second deliverable is the research repository detailing a reproducible simulation that I submitted as my exercise for week 4. It is on this pull request: https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2023/pull/3, named 'add Week 4 exercise Carlos Poses".

My third deliverable is my personal website, which can be found here: https://carlosposes.github.io/. The code can be found here: https://github.com/CarlosPoses/CarlosPoses.github.io and is written in Quarto; pushing to that repo automatically updates the website. A .zip version of the repo can also be found on this folder.

My fourth deliverable is the Shinny App that can be checked here: https://carlosposes.shinyapps.io/spainmap/, whose source code can be checked here: https://github.com/CarlosPoses/MapSpain. 

My fifth deliverable is the presentation of my research report, in the folder 'Presentation'. It is written in Quarto, and it is also my submission for Week 2. The fully reproducible environment repo is included in the week 2, on this PR: https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2023/pull/12. Here I copied only the presentation and Quarto code (not the .renv or data files), to avoid excessive duplication of files.
