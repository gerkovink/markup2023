A travel survey is conducted to find out the movement patterns of people in a particular area (@harding_are_2021). Initially, it was conducted with paper-based interviews and recently travel surveys can be conducted through an application or web-based surveys by collecting travel diaries completed by respondents (@shen_review_2014). However, the efficacy of this approach is somewhat limited as each respondent should document the daily activities undertaken. An innovation in travel surveys by collecting respondents' locations using Global Positional System (GPS) sensor data was recognized by Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek or CBS) in 2017.

The growing popularity of smartphones is enabling the emergence of smart city applications (@f_de_s_soares_combined_2019-1). Collecting GPS sensor data could be useful for identifying movement patterns and portraying the movement behaviour (@calabrese_understanding_2013). Based on the GPS sensor data, an automated diary is generated for the survey respondent, wherein each day is discretized into distinct segments representing stationary periods (stops) and periods of travel (tracks). This approach, in addition, can reduce recall bias, can collect a lot of data with minimal effort and is less time-consuming, although validation problems might be encountered (@zhou_smartphone-based_2022-1).

## Equation

This is the example of an equation. When $a_n$ is $3n+1$ then $n$ is odd and when $n$ is even $a_n =n / 2$. \begin{equation*}
    a_n = \begin{cases}
              3n + 1  & \text{ if } n \text{ is odd} \\
              \int_{1}^{n} 2x \,dx & \text{ otherwise}
          \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

For example, if $n=3,4,5$, then $a_n$: \begin{align}
a_3 = 3 \times 3 + 1 = 10 \\
a_4 = 4^2 - 1^2 = 15\\
a_5 = 3 \times 5 + 1 = 16 
\end{align}

## R-code Displayed Not Executed

In this program, we convert decimal number entered by the user into binary using a recursive function. Decimal number is converted into binary by dividing the number successively by 2 and printing the remainder in reverse order.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
convert_to_binary <- function(n) {
  if(n > 1) {
    convert_to_binary(as.integer(n/2))
    }
  cat(n %% 2)
}
convert_to_binary (100)

```

## R-code Executed Not Displayed

This is an example of the ggplot implementation to create a plot. The dataset used in this code is iris dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=iris,aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length,color=Species)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()
```

## Cached and Labeled R-code

This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas. A data frame with 50 observations on 4 variables. - Murder numeric Murder arrests (per 100,000) - Assault numeric Assault arrests (per 100,000) - UrbanPop numeric Percent urban population - Rape numeric Rape arrests (per 100,000)

```{r}
#| cache: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| label: PCA
library(ggplot2)      
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
library(corrr)
library(DT)

corrplot(cor(USArrests), order = "hclust")

pca.res <- prcomp(USArrests, scale = TRUE)
pca.res$rotation

pca.var <- pca.res$sdev ^2
var.ratio <- pca.var/sum(pca.var)

plot(var.ratio , xlab=" Principal Component ", ylab=" Proportion of
Variance Explained ", ylim=c(0,1) ,type="b")
```

## Reproducible Environment

```{r}
library(renv)
renv::init()
renv::activate()
renv::status()
```
