The goal of this manuscript is to reproduce the simulation study performed in Boulesteix, Groenwold, Abrahamowicz, et al. (2020). In this paper a small scale simulation study is conducted to investigate  the impact of measurement error on (continuous) exposure and/or (continuous) confounding variable.

The data necessary to reproduce the results are stored in the subfolder called "data"
The r script with all the necessary r commands is stored in the subfolder called "Rscripts"
The figure representing the results is stored in the subfolder called "results"
The commented code to reproduce the simulation results is given in "sim_research.qmd" quarto document
The rendered html version of it is given in "sim_research.html"
The references used are stored in "references.bib"
