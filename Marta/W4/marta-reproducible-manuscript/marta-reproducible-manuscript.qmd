## Meet the penguins
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The penguins data from [palmerpenguins](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/readme/README.html) (@horst) package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. In particular `r sum(penguins$species=='Adelie')` belonging to the Adelie species, `r sum(penguins$species=='Chinstrap')`belonging to the Chinstrap species and `r sum(penguins$species=='Gentoo')`belonging to the Gentoo species.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lenghts of these penguins
