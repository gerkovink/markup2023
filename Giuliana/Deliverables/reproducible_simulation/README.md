# Simulation study replication

Project Summary:

This repository contains a replication of a simulation study by Boulesteix, Groenwold, Abrahamowicz, and others (2020). We've converted the original study into a user-friendly format that follows the structure of a research compendium.

In this compendium are the files needed to replicate Boulesteix et al.'s study. All necessary data for the study are also included.
