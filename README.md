Course collaboration for Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming in Statistics 2023 @ Utrecht University

# Deliverables

The [Markup manuscript](https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/Thesis/tree/main/docs/Thesis_Manuscript) (1) and [Open Science repository](https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/Thesis) (2) is available at [https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/Thesis](https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/Thesis). This is written using the reproducible manuscript format and the `rticles` package. This package produces a format for Wiley's Statistics in Medicine using LaTeX. Furthermore, it is a reproducible simulation study using R. The Readme-file provides information on the simulation procedure.

My personal developers portfolio (3) is available at [hiddevandebeek.github.io](https://hiddevandebeek.github.io/). The .zip is available at the [deliverables](./deliverables) section of this project. It is a personal webpage providing a view into my interests and study progress. The code is openly available at [https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/hiddevandebeek.github.io](https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/hiddevandebeek.github.io)

Lastly, a Shiny app (4) is live available at https://tbh1u4-hidde0van0de0beek.shinyapps.io/auc_in_a_simulation/. The code is available at [https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/Visualizing-Logistic-Distributions](https://github.com/hiddevandebeek/Visualizing-Logistic-Distributions). It visualizes the change of two distributions while keeping other parameters constant (such as AUC, Sigma and Mu).
