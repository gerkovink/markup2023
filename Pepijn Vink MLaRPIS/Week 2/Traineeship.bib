  abstract = {Learning graphical models from data is an important problem with wide applications, ranging from genomics to the social sciences. Nowadays datasets often have upwards of thousands---sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands---of variables and far fewer samples. To meet this challenge, we have developed a new R package called sparsebn for learning the structure of large, sparse graphical models with a focus on Bayesian networks. While there are many existing software packages for this task, this package focuses on the unique setting of learning large networks from high-dimensional data, possibly with interventions. As such, the methods provided place a premium on scalability and consistency in a high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, in the presence of interventions, the methods implemented here achieve the goal of learning a causal network from data. Additionally, the sparsebn package is fully compatible with existing software packages for network analysis.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider Gaussian models Markov with respect to an arbitrary DAG. We first construct a family of conjugate priors for the Cholesky parametrization of the covariance matrix of such models. This family has as many shape parameters as the DAG has vertices, and naturally extends the work of Geiger and Heckerman [8]. From these distributions, we derive prior distributions for the covariance and precision parameters of the Gaussian DAG Markov models. Our works thus extends the work of Dawid and Lauritzen [5] and Letac and Massam [16] for Gaussian models Markov with respect to a decomposable graph to arbitrary DAGs. For this reason, we call our distributions DAG-Wishart distributions. An advantage of these distributions is that they possess strong hyper Markov properties and thus allow for explicit estimation of the covariance and precision parameters, regardless of the dimension of the problem. They also allow us to develop methodology for model selection and covariance estimation in the space of DAG-Markov models. We demonstrate via several numerical examples that the proposed method scales well to high-dimensions.},

Specifically, we construct objective priors for model selection based on the Fractional Bayes Factor, leading to a closed form expression for the marginal likelihood of an EG. Next we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy to explore the space of EGs using sparsity constraints, and illustrate the performance of our method on simulation studies, as well as on a real dataset. Our method provides a coherent quantification of inferential uncertainty, requires minimal prior specification, and shows to be competitive in learning the structure of the data-generating EG when compared to alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Conditionally on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we assume that the joint law of the random variables can be factorized according to the DAG, where each term is a categorical distribution for the node-variable given a configuration of its parents. The graph is equipped with a causal interpretation through the notion of interventional distribution and the allied ``do-calculus''. From a modeling perspective, the likelihood is decomposed into a product over nodes and parents of DAG-parameters, on which a suitably specified collection of Dirichlet priors is assigned. The overall joint distribution on the ensemble of DAG-parameters is then constructed using global and local independence. We account for DAG-model uncertainty and propose a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which targets the joint posterior over DAGs and DAG-parameters; from the output we are able to recover a full posterior distribution of any causal effect coefficient of interest, possibly summarized by a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) point estimate. We validate our method through extensive simulation studies, wherein comparisons with alternative state-ofthe-art procedures reveal an outperformance in terms of estimation accuracy.

However, in their mission to maximise a scoring function, many become conservative and minimise edges discovered. While simplicity is desired, the output is often a graph that consists of multiple independent subgraphs that do not enable full propagation of evidence. While this is not a problem in theory, it can be a problem in practice. This article examines a novel unconventional associational heuristic called Saiyan, which returns a directed acyclic graph that enables full propagation of evidence. Associational heuristics are not expected to perform well relative to sophisticated constraint-based and score-based learning approaches. Moreover, forcing the algorithm to connect all data variables implies that the forced edges will not be correct at the rate of those identified unrestrictedly. Still, synthetic and real-world experiments suggest that such a heuristic can be competitive relative to some of the well-established constraint-based, score-based and hybrid learning algorithms.},

The standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms used for learning DAGs are random-walk Metropolis-Hastings samplers. These samplers are guaranteed to converge asymptotically but often mix slowly when exploring the large graph spaces that arise in structure learning. In each step, the sampler we propose draws entire sets of parents for multiple nodes from the appropriate conditional distribution. This provides an efficient way to make large moves in graph space, permitting faster mixing whilst retaining asymptotic guarantees of convergence. The conditional distribution is related to variable selection with candidate parents playing the role of covariates or inputs. We empirically examine the performance of the sampler using several simulated and real data examples. The proposed method gives robust results in diverse settings, outperforming several existing Bayesian and frequentist methods. In addition, our empirical results shed some light on the relative merits of Bayesian and constraint-based methods for structure learning.},

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a special class of directed graphical models, where all the edges are directed edges and contain no directed cycles. The DAGs are well known models for discovering causal relationships between genes in gene regulatory networks. However, estimating DAGs without assuming known ordering is challenging due to high dimensionality, the acyclic constraints, and the presence of equivalence class from observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage adaptive Lasso approach, called NS-DIST, which performs neighborhood selection (NS) in stage 1, and then estimates DAGs by the discrete improving search with Tabu (DIST) algorithm within the selected neighborhood. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and its computational efficiency. Two real data examples are used to demonstrate the practical usage of our method for gene regulatory network inference. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

For the general case (k{$>$}1), which is NP-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing.

We advocate for a novel order called removable order (r-order) as they are advantageous over c-orders for structure learning. This is because r-orders are the minimizers of an appropriately defined optimization problem that could be either solved exactly (using a reinforcement learning approach) or approximately (using a hill-climbing search). Moreover, the r-orders (unlike c-orders) are invariant among all the graphs in a MEC and include c-orders as a subset. Given that set of r-orders is often significantly larger than the set of c-orders, it is easier for the optimization problem to find an r-order instead of a c-order. We evaluate the performance and the scalability of our proposed approaches on both real-world and randomly generated networks.},

We show the strong selection consistency of the proposed method in the sense that the posterior probability of the true model converges to one even when the number of covariates grows nearly exponentially with the sample size. This is arguably the strongest selection consistency result that has been available in the Bayesian variable selection literature; yet the proposed method can be carried out through posterior sampling with a simple Gibbs sampler.

They allow for holistic, systems-level view of the various biological processes, for intuitive and rigorous understanding and interpretations. In the context of large networks, Bayesian approaches are particularly suitable because it encourages sparsity of the graphs, incorporate prior information, and most importantly account for uncertainty in the graph structure. These features are particularly important in applications with limited sample size, including genomics and imaging studies. In this paper, we review several recently developed techniques for the analysis of large networks under non-standard settings, including but not limited to, multiple graphs for data observed from multiple related subgroups, graphical regression approaches used for the analysis of networks that change with covariates, and other complex sampling and structural settings. We also illustrate the practical utility of some of these methods using examples in cancer genomics and neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {The application of certain Bayesian techniques, such as the Bayes factor and model averaging, requires the specification of prior distributions on the parameters of alternative models. We propose a new method for constructing compatible priors on the parameters of models nested in a given directed acyclic graph model, using a conditioning approach. We define a class of parameterizations that is consistent with the modular structure of the directed acyclic graph and derive a procedure, that is invariant within this class, which we name reference conditioning.},

  abstract = {A necessary step in the development of artificial intelligence is to enable a machine to represent how the world works, building an internal structure from data. This structure should hold a good trade-off between expressive power and querying efficiency. Bayesian networks have proven to be an effective and versatile tool for the task at hand. They have been applied to modeling knowledge in a variety of fields, ranging from bioinformatics to law, from image processing to economic risk analysis. A crucial aspect is learning the dependency graph of a Bayesian network from data. This task, called structure learning, is NP-hard and is the subject of intense, cutting-edge research. In short, it can be thought of as choosing one graph over the many candidates, grounding our reasoning over a collection of samples of the distribution generating the data. The number of possible graphs increases very quickly at the increase in the number of variables. Searching in this space, and selecting a graph over the others, becomes quickly burdensome. In this survey, we review the most relevant structure learning algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. We classify them according to the approach they follow for solving the problem and we also show alternatives for handling missing data and continuous variable. An extensive review of existing software tools is also given.},

  title = {The {{Hidden Life}} of {{Latent Variables}}: {{Bayesian Learning}} with {{Mixed Graph Models}}},
  author = {Silva, Ricardo and Ghahramani, Zoubin},
  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been widely used as a representation of conditional independence in machine learning and statistics. Moreover, hidden or latent variables are often an important component of graphical models. However, DAG models suffer from an important limitation: the family of DAGs is not closed under marginalization of hidden variables. This means that in general we cannot use a DAG to represent the independencies over a subset of variables in a larger DAG. Directed mixed graphs (DMGs) are a representation that includes DAGs as a special case, and overcomes this limitation. This paper introduces algorithms for performing Bayesian inference in Gaussian and probit DMG models. An important requirement for inference is the specification of the distribution over parameters of the models. We introduce a new distribution for covariance matrices of Gaussian DMGs. We discuss and illustrate how several Bayesian machine learning tasks can benefit from the principle presented here: the power to model dependencies that are generated from hidden variables, but without necessarily modeling such variables explicitly.},

It is shown how one can introduce imprecision into such probabilities as a data base of cases accumulates. By exploiting the graphical structure, the updating can be performed locally, either approximately or exactly, and the setup makes it possible to take advantage of a range of well-established statistical techniques. As examples we discuss discrete models, models based on Dirichlet distributions and models of the logistic regression type.},

The algorithm combines ideas from local learning, constraint-based, and search-and-score techniques in a principled and effective way. It first reconstructs the skeleton of a Bayesian network and then performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges. In our extensive empirical evaluation MMHC outperforms on average and in terms of various metrics several prototypical and state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the PC, Sparse Candidate, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, Greedy Equivalence Search, and Greedy Search. These are the first empirical results simultaneously comparing most of the major Bayesian network algorithms against each other. MMHC offers certain theoretical advantages, specifically over the Sparse Candidate algorithm, corroborated by our experiments. MMHC and detailed results of our study are publicly available at http://www.dsl-lab.org/supplements/mmhc\_paper/mmhc\_index.html.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic graphical models are graphical representations of probability distributions. Graphical models have applications in many fields including biology, social sciences, linguistic, neuroscience. In this paper, we propose directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) learning via bootstrap aggregating. The proposed procedure is named as DAGBag. Specifically, an ensemble of DAGs is first learned based on bootstrap resamples of the data and then an aggregated DAG is derived by minimizing the overall distance to the entire ensemble. A family of metrics based on the structural hamming distance is defined for the space of DAGs (of a given node set) and is used for aggregation. Under the high-dimensional-low-sample size setting, the graph learned on one data set often has excessive number of false positive edges due to over-fitting of the noise. Aggregation overcomes over-fitting through variance reduction and thus greatly reduces false positives. We also develop an efficient implementation of the hill climbing search algorithm of DAG learning which makes the proposed method computationally competitive for the high-dimensional regime. The DAGBag procedure is implemented in the R package dagbag.},

In our approach, search for separators of a pair of variables in a large DAG is localized to small subsets, and thus the approach can improve the efficiency of searches and the power of statistical tests for structural learning. We show how the recent advances in the learning of undirected graphical models can be employed to facilitate the decomposition.

  abstract = {Recently directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure learning is formulated as a constrained continuous optimization problem with continuous acyclicity constraints and was solved iteratively through subproblem optimization. To further improve efficiency, we propose a novel learning framework to model and learn the weighted adjacency matrices in the DAG space directly. Specifically, we first show that the set of weighted adjacency matrices of DAGs are equivalent to the set of weighted gradients of graph potential functions, and one may perform structure learning by searching in this equivalent set of DAGs. To instantiate this idea, we propose a new algorithm, DAG-NoCurl, which solves the optimization problem efficiently with a two-step procedure: \$1)\$ first we find an initial non-acyclic solution to the optimization problem, and \$2)\$ then we employ the Hodge decomposition of graphs and learn an acyclic graph by projecting the non-acyclic graph to the gradient of a potential function. Experimental studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method provides comparable accuracy but better efficiency than baseline DAG structure learning methods on both linear and generalized structural equation models, often by more than one order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Structure Learning for Bayesian network (BN) is an important problem with extensive research. It plays central roles in a wide variety of applications in Alibaba Group. However, existing structure learning algorithms suffer from considerable limitations in real-world applications due to their low efficiency and poor scalability. To resolve this, we propose a new structure learning algorithm LEAST, which comprehensively fulfills our business requirements as it attains high accuracy, efficiency and scalability at the same time. The core idea of LEAST is to formulate the structure learning into a continuous constrained optimization problem, with a novel differentiable constraint function measuring the acyclicity of the resulting graph. Unlike with existing work, our constraint function is built on the spectral radius of the graph and could be evaluated in near linear time w.r.t. the graph node size. Based on it, LEAST can be efficiently implemented with low storage overhead. According to our benchmark evaluation, LEAST runs 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art method with comparable accuracy, and it is able to scale on BNs with up to hundreds of thousands of variables. In our production environment, LEAST is deployed and serves for more than 20 applications with thousands of executions per day. We describe a concrete scenario in a ticket booking service in Alibaba, where LEAST is applied to build a near real-time automatic anomaly detection and root error cause analysis system. We also show that LEAST unlocks the possibility of applying BN structure learning in new areas, such as large-scale gene expression data analysis and explainable recommendation system.},
